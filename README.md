In my project "Labour in Construction," I worked with Eurostat data to analyze and gain insights into the construction industry. I retrieved the data and preprocessed it to ensure its suitability for analysis. This involved cleaning, organizing, and transforming the data to remove inconsistencies. Using various statistical techniques, I performed an in-depth analysis of the construction labor data, exploring different measures and patterns to understand trends and uncover insights. For comparative analysis, I focused on comparing labor statistics between Ireland and the United Kingdom. 

Through thorough examination, I identified similarities, differences, and potential factors influencing labor trends in these regions. To effectively communicate the findings, I visualized the results using graphs and charts, providing clear and concise presentations of the analyzed data. In addition, I employed machine learning techniques, specifically using Python, to make predictions related to the construction labor industry. This involved developing models to forecast future labor trends, providing valuable insights for decision-making. For data management, I utilized MySQL as the database management system, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of relevant data.
To expand the project's scope, I incorporated sentiment analysis by leveraging Reddit's API. By collecting data from construction labor discussions, I conducted sentiment analysis to gain insights into public opinion and sentiments regarding the industry.

Throughout the project, I documented each step and code on GitHub, ensuring transparency and enabling collaboration with others interested in exploring or replicating the analysis.
